# lets get into the GCP shell 
Open Google Cloud Shell terminal 

# Lets make a sandpit 
Before doing this, check that you are in the correct project area in GCP. FOr this case its the 'Hello_world helical-sled-221702'

git pull origin master	

# The tutorial says we need to get into this part of the folder:
cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python37/hello_world
	
cat main.py
cat app.yaml

# Create the virtualenv for this folder - Hello_world
virtualenv --python python3 \
    ~/envs/hello_world

# now Actiivate the virtualenv
source \
    ~/envs/hello_world/bin/activate

# Lets install the dependencies 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test run the app 
python main.py

# Now deploy it

# Note about the .js file 
The testing deployment was successful but, the web wasn't working as expected. So i did some debuging and turns out the index.html file on templates required some changes. 
I followed this web - https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/javascript-guide
SO what I did was modify that one line on the html file and included the extra line: 
   <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/client.js"></script>


# Now time to deploy!
gcloud app create
gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project digit-recogniser-123
